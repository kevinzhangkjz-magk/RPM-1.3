# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & CI/CD Setup

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a structured monorepo with separate frontend and backend packages and a basic CI/CD pipeline,
**so that** I have a stable foundation to build and deploy the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A monorepo is initialized with a standard directory structure.
2. A frontend application shell (e.g., using Next.js) is created.
3. A backend application shell (e.g., using a Python/FastAPI template) is created.
4. A basic CI/CD pipeline is configured to run linter checks and build both applications on push.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize a new Git repository.
- [ ] Initialize a new Turborepo monorepo using `npx create-turbo@latest`.
- [ ] Create the `apps/web` directory and scaffold a new Next.js + TypeScript application inside it.
- [ ] Create the `apps/api` directory and scaffold a new Python/FastAPI application inside it.
- [ ] Create the `packages/` directory for future shared code (`shared-types`, `eslint-config`, `tsconfig`).
- [ ] Configure the root `package.json` with workspaces and the `dev`, `build`, and `test` scripts as defined in the architecture.
- [ ] Create a basic `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` file that checks out the code, installs dependencies, and runs the `build` and `lint` commands.
