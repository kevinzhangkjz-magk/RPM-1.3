   ppa_rate = 50.0  # Hardcoded
   
   # Suggested
   ppa_rate = settings.default_ppa_rate or 50.0
   ```

2. **Simplify Import Logic**: Create robust import resolver
   ```python
   # Instead of multiple try/except blocks
   from utils.import_resolver import safe_import
   ai_widgets = safe_import('components.ai_widgets')
   ```

3. **Type Hints**: Add comprehensive type hints for better IDE support

### Compliance Check
