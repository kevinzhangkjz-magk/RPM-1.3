# Story 2.3: Inverter-Level Visualization UI

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Solar Asset Manager,
**I want** to select an underperforming skid and see a comparative view of all its inverters,
**so that** I can pinpoint the specific faulty inverter.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. From the Skid-Level View, a user can select a specific skid.
2. Selecting a skid transitions the UI to an Inverter-Level View for that skid.
3. The Inverter-Level View displays a comparative visualization of all inverters for the selected skid.
4. The view clearly highlights the specific inverter(s) causing the underperformance.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Frontend**: In the `Skid-Level View` component, make the list or chart of skids interactive.
- [ ] **Frontend**: Create a new component to represent the "Inverter-Level View".
- [ ] **Frontend**: When a user selects a skid, use the `skid_id` to fetch data from the `GET /api/skids/{skid_id}/inverters` endpoint via the TanStack Query service layer.
- [ ] **Frontend**: In the new component, use a charting library to display a comparative visualization of all inverters on the selected skid.
- [ ] **Frontend**: Implement logic to visually highlight the specific underperforming inverter(s) in the chart or a corresponding table.
- [ ] **Frontend**: Ensure the UI's breadcrumbs and titles update to reflect the new Inverter-Level View (e.g., `... > [Skid ID] > Inverters`).
- [ ] **Frontend**: Write Jest/RTL unit tests for the new Inverter-Level View component.

## Dev Notes
The developer must build the final layer of the drill-down UI, completing the primary user flow.

### API Endpoint to Use
* **`GET /api/skids/{skid_id}/inverters`**: This endpoint was created in Story 2.1 and provides the necessary performance data for all inverters on a specific skid.

### UI/UX Guidance
* This view is the final step in the drill-down analysis flow.
* The main chart area should update to show the new inverter comparison.
* The side panel should display the list of inverters with their performance metrics.
* Breadcrumbs must be updated to the final level: `Portfolio > [Site Name] > [Skid ID] > Inverters`.
