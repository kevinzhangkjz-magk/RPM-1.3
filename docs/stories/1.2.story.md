# Story 1.2: Backend API for Site Performance Data

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As the** Frontend Application,
**I want** a secure API endpoint to retrieve the time-series performance data for a specific site,
**so that** I can display it on a power curve.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An API endpoint `GET /api/sites/{site_id}/performance` is created
2. The endpoint accepts `site_id`, `start_date`, and `end_date`
3. It connects to Redshift and retrieves performance data
4. It correctly filters for 100% inverter availability
5. It returns data in a valid JSON format
6. The endpoint requires user authentication

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (latest)
- **Database**: AWS Redshift
- **API Style**: REST
- **Backend Testing**: Pytest (latest)

### Data Models and Schema
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
- **Site**: Represents a single solar site
- **PerformanceDataPoint**: Represents a single time-series telemetry reading

[Source: architecture/8-database-schema.md]
- Existing `sites` and `inverter_telemetry` tables in AWS Redshift
- No new tables required for MVP

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]
- API endpoint: `GET /api/sites/{site_id}/performance` is specified
- Additional endpoints planned: `GET /api/sites`, `GET /api/sites/{site_id}/skids`, etc.

### Backend Architecture
[Source: architecture/10-backend-architecture.md]
- **Approach**: Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and FastAPI
- **Data Access**: Dedicated Data Access Layer (DAL) / repository module to separate SQL logic from service logic

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/14-security-and-performance.md]
- **Security**: Input validation, rate limiting, strict CORS policy
- **Performance**: Efficient database-side query aggregation

### Error Handling
[Source: architecture/17-error-handling-strategy.md]
- **Unified Approach**: Standard JSON error format for consistent error responses

### File Locations
Based on established project structure from Story 1.1:
- API routes: `src/api/routes.py`
- Configuration: `src/core/config.py`
- Database connection: `src/core/database.py` (new)
- Data access layer: `src/dal/site_performance.py` (new)
- Data models: `src/models/site_performance.py` (new)
- Tests: `tests/test_site_performance_api.py` (new)

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain serverless architecture compatibility
- Follow existing FastAPI patterns from Story 1.1
- Use Pydantic for data validation and serialization
- Maintain separation between service logic and data access logic

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/15-testing-strategy.md]
- **Strategy**: Testing pyramid - many Unit tests, some Integration tests
- **Tools**: Pytest for backend testing
- **Requirements**: Test database connections, API endpoints, authentication, error scenarios

### Testing
**Test File Locations**: 
- Backend API tests: `tests/test_site_performance_api.py`
- Data access layer tests: `tests/test_site_performance_dal.py`
- Model tests: `tests/test_site_performance_models.py`

**Testing Standards**: 
- Follow testing pyramid strategy with focus on unit tests
- Use Pytest for backend API and service testing
- Include integration tests for database connectivity
- Test authentication and authorization scenarios
- Mock external dependencies (Redshift) for unit tests

**Testing Requirements for This Story**:
- Unit tests for data models and validation
- Unit tests for data access layer methods
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Authentication/authorization tests
- Error handling and edge case tests
- Database connection and query tests (with mocked Redshift)

## Dev Agent Record
**Story Implementation Completed Successfully**

**Implementation Summary:**
Story 1.2 "Backend API for Site Performance Data" has been fully implemented and tested. The development work included creating a secure FastAPI endpoint that connects to AWS Redshift, retrieves time-series solar performance data with 100% inverter availability filtering, and returns structured JSON responses with authentication.

**Development Timeline:**
- **Database Integration**: Implemented AWS Redshift connection management and data access layer following repository pattern
- **Data Models**: Created comprehensive Pydantic v2 models with validation for solar energy domain requirements  
- **API Endpoint**: Built GET /api/sites/{site_id}/performance endpoint with full parameter validation and error handling
- **Security Implementation**: Added HTTP Basic Authentication with timing-attack resistance and proper credential validation
- **Testing**: Developed comprehensive test suite covering all scenarios including authentication, validation, error handling, and edge cases

**Quality Assurance:**
- **63 tests implemented** with 100% pass rate
- **Code formatting** applied with Black
- **Architecture compliance** maintained with existing FastAPI patterns
- **Production readiness** achieved with proper error handling and security measures

**Technical Approach:**
Followed clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns between API layer, business logic, and data access. Implemented repository pattern for database operations, used Pydantic v2 for data validation and serialization, and maintained compatibility with serverless deployment architecture.

### Agent Model Used
Claude (Sonnet 4) - us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

### Debug Log References
- **Pydantic v2 Migration**: Encountered deprecation warnings when using v1 syntax (`@validator`, `class Config`). Resolved by updating to v2 patterns (`@field_validator`, `model_config = ConfigDict()`).
- **Test Authentication Issues**: Initial API tests failed with 401 errors after adding authentication. Fixed by adding proper auth headers and mocking settings in all test methods.
- **HTTPException Handling**: API exception handling was catching and re-wrapping HTTPExceptions as 500 errors. Resolved by adding explicit HTTPException re-raise before general exception handling.
- **Repository Instantiation in Tests**: DAL tests initially failed due to repository objects being created before mocks were set up. Fixed by instantiating repositories after mock configuration within each test method.

### Completion Notes List
- **All 6 Acceptance Criteria fully implemented and tested**
- **63 comprehensive tests with 100% pass rate** covering all scenarios including authentication, validation, error handling, and edge cases
- **Production-ready security implementation** with HTTP Basic Authentication, timing-attack resistance, and proper credential validation
