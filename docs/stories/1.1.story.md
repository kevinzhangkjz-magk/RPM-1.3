# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & CI/CD Setup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a structured monorepo with separate frontend and backend packages and a basic CI/CD pipeline,
**so that** I have a stable foundation to build and deploy the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A monorepo is initialized
2. A frontend application shell is created
3. A backend application shell is created
4. A basic CI/CD pipeline is configured to run linter checks and build both applications

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Initialize monorepo structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Set up Turborepo configuration
  - [x] Create root package.json with workspace definitions
  - [x] Configure monorepo scripts and build system
- [x] Task 2: Create frontend application shell (AC: 2)
  - [x] Set up Next.js 14+ application in apps/frontend
  - [x] Configure TypeScript 5.4+ setup
  - [x] Install and configure ShadCN/UI components
  - [x] Set up basic routing structure with Next.js App Router
- [x] Task 3: Create backend application shell (AC: 3)
  - [x] Set up FastAPI application in apps/backend
  - [x] Configure Python 3.11+ environment and dependencies
  - [x] Set up project structure for serverless architecture
  - [x] Configure basic API route structure
- [x] Task 4: Configure CI/CD pipeline (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create GitHub Actions workflow file
  - [x] Configure linting for both frontend (ESLint) and backend (Python linting)
  - [x] Configure build processes for both applications
  - [x] Set up automated testing pipeline

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story - this is the first story in the project.

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript 5.4+, ShadCN/UI components
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python 3.11+
- **Build System**: Turborepo for monorepo management
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration/deployment
- **Testing**: Jest & RTL (Frontend), Pytest (Backend), Playwright (E2E)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK for Infrastructure as Code

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/9-frontend-architecture.md]
- **Component Organization**: Feature-based structure (components/ui, components/features)
- **State Management**: Zustand for global client-side state
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management

[Source: architecture/10-backend-architecture.md]
- **Approach**: Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and FastAPI
- **Data Access**: Dedicated Data Access Layer (DAL) / repository module for SQL separation

[Source: architecture/13-deployment-architecture.md]
- **Frontend Deployment**: AWS Amplify Hosting linked to GitHub main branch
- **Backend Deployment**: AWS CDK scripts via GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- **Environments**: Development, Staging, and Production configurations

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: architecture/11-unified-project-structure.md]
Monorepo folder structure for apps and packages is defined in the architecture documents.

### File Locations
Based on architecture guidance:
- Frontend app: `apps/frontend/` (Next.js application)
- Backend app: `apps/backend/` (FastAPI application)
- Root configuration files: `package.json`, `turbo.json`
- CI/CD configuration: `.github/workflows/`

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript 5.4+ for type safety
- Python 3.11+ for backend
- AWS-focused infrastructure approach
- Serverless architecture pattern

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/15-testing-strategy.md]
- **Strategy**: Testing pyramid - many Unit tests, some Integration tests, few E2E tests
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest & React Testing Library
- **Backend Testing**: Pytest
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright
- **Integration**: Tests should be integrated into CI/CD pipeline

### Testing
**Test File Locations**: 
- Frontend tests: `apps/frontend/__tests__/` or colocated `*.test.ts` files
- Backend tests: `apps/backend/tests/` or colocated `test_*.py` files

**Testing Standards**: 
- Follow testing pyramid strategy with focus on unit tests
- Use Jest & RTL for frontend component testing
- Use Pytest for backend API and service testing
- Integrate all tests into CI/CD pipeline for automated execution

**Testing Requirements for This Story**:
- Unit tests for basic application initialization
- CI/CD pipeline validation tests
- Build process verification tests
