# Story 3.1: Backend API for AI Assistant

## Status
Done

## Story
**As the** Frontend Application,
**I want** a single API endpoint that can process natural language queries,
**so that** I can provide users with AI-driven diagnostic answers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new API endpoint `POST /api/query` is created.
2. The endpoint accepts a JSON payload containing a natural language string (the user's question).
3. The backend logic translates the natural language query into an appropriate SQL query for Redshift.
4. The endpoint returns a structured JSON response containing a text summary, and optionally, data for a chart or table.
5. The endpoint can successfully process and provide accurate answers for the five predefined MVP diagnostic questions.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Backend**: In the `apps/api` project, create a new router file for the AI service (e.g., `apps/api/app/routers/ai.py`).
- [x] **Backend**: In the new router, implement the `POST /api/query` endpoint.
- [x] **Backend**: Create a new service module for the AI logic (e.g., `apps/api/app/services/ai_service.py`).
- [x] **Backend**: In the AI service, implement a function to parse the incoming natural language query. For the MVP, this can be a keyword-based parser.
- [x] **Backend**: The parser must be able to identify which of the five predefined questions is being asked and extract any necessary parameters (e.g., Site Name, Dates).
- [x] **Backend**: Based on the identified question, the AI service will call the appropriate function(s) in the Data Access Layer (DAL) to get the required data.
- [x] **Backend**: Implement logic to synthesize the fetched data into a human-readable text summary.
- [x] **Backend**: Write Pytest unit tests for the AI service, testing its ability to correctly parse and answer each of the five predefined questions.

## Dev Notes
The developer must create the backend logic for the AI assistant.
**MVP Scope Clarification**: A complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) model is not required for the MVP. The backend should use a simpler method, like keyword matching or regex, to recognize and handle the five specific questions defined below.

### API Specification
* **`POST /api/query`**:
    * **Purpose**: Send a natural language question from the user to the AI assistant for processing.


### Five Predefined MVP Diagnostic Questions to Support
1.  "Show me the power curve for **[Site Name]** for **[Time Range]** and highlight periods of significant underperformance."
2.  "Which skids and inverters at **[Site Name]** showed the worst performance against the model **[Time Range]**?"
3.  "Generate the individual power curve for inverter **[Inverter ID]** at **[Site Name]** for the **[Time Range]**."
4.  "What were the RMSE and R-squared values between the actual and expected power for **[Site Name]** **[Time Range]**?"
5.  "Compare the power curves for **[Skid A ID]** and **[Skid B ID]** at **[Site Name]** for **[Time Range]**."

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented the Backend AI Assistant API with all acceptance criteria met.

### File List (New/Modified)
- **Created**: `apps/backend/src/api/ai.py` - AI router with POST /api/query endpoint
- **Created**: `apps/backend/src/services/ai_service.py` - AI service with natural language processing
- **Created**: `apps/backend/tests/test_ai_service.py` - Comprehensive unit tests
- **Modified**: `apps/backend/main.py` - Added AI router to application
- **Modified**: `docs/stories/3.1.story.md` - Updated with completion details

### Agent Model Used
Opus 4 (claude-opus-4-20250514)

### Debug Log References
- All 16 unit tests passing for AI service functionality
- Keyword-based parser successfully identifies all 5 predefined MVP questions
- Natural language processing extracts site names and time ranges correctly
- Repository pattern integration working with existing DAL layer

### Completion Notes
- ✅ POST /api/query endpoint created and functional
- ✅ Natural language parser implemented using regex patterns
- ✅ All 5 predefined MVP diagnostic questions supported
- ✅ Data synthesis generates human-readable summaries with statistics
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (16 test cases)
- ✅ Error handling for malformed queries and missing parameters
- ✅ Time range extraction supports multiple formats (last month, specific months, etc.)
- ✅ Integration with existing Repository pattern for data access

### Notes
The implementation uses a simplified keyword-based approach as specified for MVP. The AI service integrates with existing Repository classes for data access and generates comprehensive summaries with statistical analysis.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: Excellent implementation with solid architecture and comprehensive testing. The AI service follows clean code principles with proper separation of concerns. The developer successfully implemented all acceptance criteria using appropriate design patterns and maintained good code quality throughout.

**Strengths**:
- Well-structured service with clear method separation for each question type
- Comprehensive test coverage (18 test cases after refactoring)
- Proper error handling and input validation
- Good use of Repository pattern integration
- Clear documentation and meaningful variable names

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `apps/backend/src/services/ai_service.py`
- **Change**: Added class constants for UNDERPERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD and TOP_WORST_PERFORMERS_COUNT
- **Why**: Eliminates magic numbers and improves maintainability
- **How**: Makes configuration changes easier and code more self-documenting

**File**: `apps/backend/src/services/ai_service.py`
- **Change**: Extracted helper methods `_calculate_performance_ratio()` and `_format_date_range_display()`
- **Why**: Reduces code duplication and improves testability
- **How**: Centralized performance calculations and date formatting logic

**File**: `apps/backend/src/api/ai.py`
- **Change**: Added Pydantic validation for query input with length limits and whitespace handling
- **Why**: Improves API robustness and prevents empty/malicious inputs
- **How**: Uses Field validation and custom validator for input sanitization

**File**: `apps/backend/src/services/ai_service.py`
- **Change**: Added basic security check for SQL injection patterns
- **Why**: Provides defense-in-depth security even though repositories handle SQL safely
- **How**: Pattern matching against common SQL injection keywords

**File**: `apps/backend/tests/test_ai_service.py`
- **Change**: Added tests for new helper methods to maintain 100% coverage
- **Why**: Ensures refactored code is properly tested
- **How**: Added TestAIServiceHelperMethods class with comprehensive test cases

### Compliance Check

### Security Review

**Security Measures Implemented**:
- Input validation with length limits (1-1000 characters)
- Basic SQL injection pattern detection
- Parameterized queries through Repository pattern
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- No direct database access from service layer

**Assessment**: Security posture is appropriate for MVP scope with good defensive programming practices.

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Efficient regex patterns for query parsing
- Minimal database calls through repository abstraction
- NumPy used for statistical calculations (RMSE, R-squared)
- Proper data structure usage for sorting and filtering

**Assessment**: Performance is suitable for expected query volumes. Statistical calculations are optimized with NumPy.

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

**Summary**: This is a high-quality implementation that demonstrates senior-level development practices. All acceptance criteria are met, code is well-architected, thoroughly tested, and includes appropriate security measures.
