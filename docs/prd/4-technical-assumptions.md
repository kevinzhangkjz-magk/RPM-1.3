# 4. Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure
* To be determined by the Architect, but a monorepo is recommended to simplify dependency management.

## Service Architecture
* The system should be designed with a decoupled architecture (e.g., microservices or serverless) to support scalability.

## Testing Requirements
* The project will require a comprehensive testing suite, including unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
* **Frontend**: React or Next.js with the ShadCN component toolkit. Streamlit is a potential alternative.
* **Backend**: A Python-based framework such as FastAPI or Flask.
* **Database**: AWS Redshift.
* **Infrastructure**: Amazon Web Services (AWS).
