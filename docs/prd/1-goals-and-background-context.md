# 1. Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* Deliver an MVP of the RPM 1.3 platform by August 15th, 2025, that successfully enables core performance analysis workflows.
* Drastically reduce the time it takes for an asset manager to diagnose underperformance, from hours or days down to minutes.
* Increase asset revenue by minimizing lost production volume through faster fault resolution.
* Consolidate the diagnostic workflow by replacing manual, multi-tool processes with a single, integrated platform.

## Background Context
The current process for diagnosing solar asset underperformance is inefficient and fragmented. Asset managers must manually analyze data across multiple tools, leading to significant delays in identifying the root cause of issues. This reactive workflow results in prolonged asset downtime and preventable revenue loss. RPM 1.3 is being developed to address these inefficiencies by creating a unified, AI-enhanced platform that provides rapid, hierarchical visualization and diagnostics, enabling a shift from reactive troubleshooting to proactive asset management.
